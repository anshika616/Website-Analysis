# Website-Analysis

## Project Objective 

To analyze website data using Python and gain insights into user behavior and website performance for better optimization.

## Questions (KPIs)

1- How many users visit the website and how does traffic vary over time?

2- Which pages receive the highest and lowest user engagement?

3- What are the key user behavior patterns (sessions, clicks, time spent)?

4- From which sources does the website get the most traffic?

5- Are there any noticeable trends or peaks in website visits?

6- Which metrics indicate strong or weak website performance?

7- What areas of the website need optimization to improve engagement?

## Process

-Collected and loaded website data using Pandas.

-Cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.

-Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand traffic, user behavior, and engagement metrics.

-Created visualizations using Matplotlib/Seaborn to identify trends and patterns.

-Analyzed results to answer key questions and derive actionable insights for website optimization.

 ## Final Conclusions

 The website analysis project successfully highlights key patterns in user behavior and traffic performance using Python. The insights help identify high-performing pages, traffic trends, and areas needing improvement, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize the website and enhance overall user engagement.
